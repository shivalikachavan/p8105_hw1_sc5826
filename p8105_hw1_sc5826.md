**Problem 1**

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

The `early_january_weather` dataset has 15 variables (origin, year,
month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust,
precip, pressure, visib, time_hour). It contains weather data
originating from EWR, between days 1 and 15 of the 1st month of 2013
(January 1-15, 2013). Data was recorded between 2013-01-01 01:00:00 and
2013-01-15 23:00:00. There are 358 total observations during this
period.

With temperature ranging between 24.08 and 57.92, we can assume these
were in Fahrenheight. The mean temperature observed in this period was
39.58F.

There is a cyclical pattern observed in temperature, where the weather
appears to peak mid-day and then falls during the night. The peaks
appear to trend upward (temperature is getting warmer), until January
14th, where it steeply drops further down. Right before the steep drop
in temperature, there also is a sharp increase in the humidity to 100.
This is higher than the average humidity during this period of
observation (65).

**Problem 2**

``` r
set.seed(123)
df_problem_2 = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric>0,
  vec_char = vector(mode="character", length=10),
  vec_factor = factor(rep(NA, 10), levels = c("A", "B", "C"))
)

mean(pull(df_problem_2, vec_numeric))
## [1] 0.07462564
mean(pull(df_problem_2, vec_logical))
## [1] 0.5
mean(pull(df_problem_2, vec_char))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(df_problem_2, vec_char)): argument is not numeric
## or logical: returning NA
## [1] NA
mean(pull(df_problem_2, vec_factor))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(df_problem_2, vec_factor)): argument is not
## numeric or logical: returning NA
## [1] NA
```

Taking the mean of the numeric and logical vector works. The logical
vector works because it can be implicitly converted to 0s and 1s, which
are numbers. Neither the character or factor vectors can be converted
into a numeric or logical vector. R then throws an error and marks the
result as `NA`.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df_problem_2, vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(df_problem_2, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(df_problem_2, vec_factor))
```

The logical vector is coerced into a numeric vector of 0s and 1s. When
the character and factor vectors are coerced into a numeric vector, each
element becomes NA because characters and factors do not have an
inherent numeric value. This is unlike logical vectors where `TRUE = 1`
and `FALSE = 0`. If a vector cannot be numeric (or logical), then the
mean cannot be calculated.
